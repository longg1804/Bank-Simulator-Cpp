**How To Use:**
- Download _bank.cpp_ and _bank.h _files, put them in the same folder.
- Open _bank.cpp_ file by Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code or DevC++,... (I recommend **Code::Blocks**) and run it.
- Enjoy!

**Notes:**
- The program can **only run on Windows**, other operating systems will be supported soon.
- After the first run, user data will be saved in _accounts_data.txt_, the most recent transaction receipt will be saved in _transaction_details.txt_, and each accountâ€™s balance changes will be saved in _FullName_Balance_Fluctuations.txt_. You can open these files anytime if you wish.
- The program is still under testing and development. If you encounter any issues or would like to suggest improvements or modifications during use, please contact me directly via email: nhlong.ptit@gmail.com.
